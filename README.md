## Memory Game (Flipping tiles)

### Features:
1. This game is based on the old concept of matching a pair of tiles with same alphabets.
2. The randomization algorithm is such that the grid is filled with random unique pairs.
3. There are "score" and "turns" counters.
4. The UI is very user-friendly. 
5. Each event on the page occurs with an animation that makes the game eye-catching. 
   Like the pulsing animation of unmatched tiles, and the rubber-band effect when they match.
6. Options for a new game (both while playing and after completing) are available.
