## Memory Game (Flipping tiles)

### Features:
1. This game is based on the old concept of matching a pair of tiles with same alphabets.
2. The randomization algorithm is such that the 4x4 grid is filled with 8 random unique pairs of letters out of the 26 english alphabets.
3. There are "score" and "turns" counters.
4. The UI is very user-friendly. 
5. Each event on the page occurs with an animation that makes the game eye-catching. 
   Like the pulsing animation of unmatched tiles, and the rubber-band effect when they match.
6. Options for a new game (both while playing and after completing) are available.
